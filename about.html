            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our goal here at Sugar Daddy's Candy Basket
            is to provide the very best candy to everyone in the world for the best prices you've ever seen! At the conception
            of this business we had many problems. First of all, legal issues were very prevalent because some countries don't
            allow certain candies due to religious reasons. This would not stop us and our fiery passion for candy. It is now legal
            in all countries for everyone in the world to enjoy!
